That is my dotfiles

Originally, that is created on windows. 

On windows the nvim folder has to be located under `~\AppData\Local\nvim`, and I didn't find how to change that, for that reason, I've put all my dotfiles under that directory, to be able to manage all of them at one place. So, that repo has the next structure:

nvim files and folders - required to run nvim
**powershel** - data required to setup powershell on windows
