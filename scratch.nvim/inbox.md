# Channel for thous who love working and would like to see results
Why are we working, because we want to see some results
Very said to work and no results
That why we are learning
So, that why good teachers are so valuable
But remember teacher can just support you and help to aquire some skill
  but you life is your life

# Thoughts - мои мысли, страхи, блоки

Тебе хочется кричать я есть, и мне хочется кричать я есть.

Это ситуация очень похожа на мою старую, в которой я был отчислен с универа и застрял на 8 лет

А она на волне этого как мне кажется пошла непонятно куда, какие-то странные истории и парни с которыми нету отношений

# VIM Inspiration to start using VIM

VIM gives so much - pleasure from work, free time on my own business and trainigns, 
  so I really want to share about that tool. It is really awesome thing from my point of view.
I think lot of developers who coding can benefit from using vim.

*quite rock in the background*
VIM like a gym, do you want strong body? Start going to gym.
VIM like a personal house that like say goodbye to parents (IDE) and go on your own house
VIM is the way to get a real enjoy from the process of writing code and anything else,
  it is allows to stay focus in literally in touch with the thing you are doing.
  At least, I feel the project like on endings of my fingers.
VIM just impressive because it allows to me do things EXACTLY as I want.

*volume increased Rock in the background*
When you look at my neovim, you look at part of my soul.

few moments of silence and rock - attention catched

What makes vim so good? DRY
You need some to develop some special way of though,
  you need learn how to recgnise patterns,
  for example, here I am making common stuff,
  select bloc, and now I want to run search and replace
  Now I want to run another search and replace across same selection,
    or in that case just want to copy paste that

lets see some sample what how I am typing with VIM without mouse 
*type in beats of the playing rock n roll with showing keys*

See you later in introduction to vim, link to Practical VIM course - lesson 1

Or if you need more reasoning 
 - check that math video that shows why actually vim increase speed of editing code in 3 times.
 - check that comparison in resource usage
 - check that comparison on how vim affects your habbits and way of think
   - it improves your brain power - because you need to work with brain all the time, that like jogging vs sleeping
     you thoughts will become sharper for free
   - it improves you minor motoric
   - it improves mood, basically, have you ever see musician being in good mood just from playing their instrumen?
   - it improves speed of typing
   - it improves your skills of problem solving, because you have a sword that can solve problem,
      bringing it with your self, at some point of time you start think, I need to use it,
      and you will learn how to use it
   - it saved you focus power *blink to my zen mode* alowing you to concetrate more on the work rather then fighting with UI
   - it allows to do things immideately
   - it allows editing via ssh easily
   - it allows to use your laptop morek
   - with time it is drammatic performance boost because of reasons mentioned above and abilities, goals of the vim itself


*btw, nice idea for the plugin - playing music and user need to type in beats different phrases*
*could be motivation phrases, could used instead of monkey typing, when miss, should not fail*

*volume decreased another* 

** Lesson 1 - basic vim motions: hjkl iv: wW eE ydp vi" di" :line number :q :w %
** Lesson 1.5 - advanced vim tools: repeat, macros, registers, search and replace with registers - to use that you need a skill to recognise a pattern, that will go just with time, here some samples
** Lesson 2 - once you are familiar with basics and know smth about vim tools, you are ready to try neovim
  install & setup
  telescope
  lsp
  git
  quickfix lists
  bang operator
  lua in command line
  next think about what you need and search for it, lets check for example copilot (even if not using that xd link to video why I am not using copilot - it interrupts my thoughts, when I am doing work I am fully inside, I have vision and ideas, and copilot breaks that state of concetration and even destroys my skill of being focused, when I feel that realy need some boileraplate I still can do that with vim, even more efficient, since it is fully under my control, e.g. I can in a minute create macors that will be doing what I need for boilerplate and that would be even more accurate in terms of cursor position, etc. Other then that I still can ask smth with AI. But last for example, I had hard issue with common js, and still the decision I have found on my own.)
** Lesson 3 - some advance neovim: bang operator, 

# Innovations

Innovations is an infinte market

By innovations I mean smth new

Inovations can bring profit in different ways, the main I think:
    1. Usefullness, when smth for life invented, e.g. electrocity
    2. Emotions from smth new. When people have enough money and food, they may want sometimes to but smth new
         or to play some game, or to learn new skill
         that empotions possible to find almost in every area - presents for birthday, even small improvements in ux
         lets say, there is a curl. And it works, but time come and somebody create new tool (curly),
         and that is innovation more from emotions (of course it maybe easier to use and more functional, however,
         the core is the same)

so 1 + 2 in different proportions may be wanted to buy

I mean people often want sometimes new, just because it is new 
  and when all "old" new bought, they still looking for smth "new" new

# Productivity

title: Doctor Productivity showing you the right setup

That could be a small series of videos, 
where two videos doing the same thing - editing few files in one project in different and creating a PR:
## Part 1 - fix a bug
1. using nvim setup for development 
2. using IntelliJ for development

## Part 2 - update two different projects in microservices arechitecture
1. using nvim setup for development 
2. using IntelliJ for development

In the end compare of time. And appauses from doctor health hands and doctor health brain

PS. Also nvim setup could reviewed by doctor health hands and doctor health brain

# Clean UX

title: Doctor Health Brain showing you the right UX

PS>I don't need to mention, that I am using nvim! They should ask, wow what editor are you using, in comments.

UX should be clean, less information come into your head - better for it

Lyke in gym, more weight - more tired

Imagine you go to help to put some metal into wagon (meme with speed wagon saying speed wagon)

And then you take few more ganteles, because it is fancy

That how it looks like for me for today

With that idea in mind I have organised my development experience.

First of all I have many projects and I want to switch between them really fast when I need,
that why I am using super fast project switcher.

Once it is opened, 95% of the time I need to open some file, thats why it is my welcome screen.

While I looking on the file, I really not interested in anything else, lets be honest,
I am not as stupid, to forget what I have opened a moment ago.

If I need some extra stuff I can use hotkeys, Doctor Health Hands helped with mapping for that

Few things I rarely needed are:
1. line number
2. col position
3. full file path
4. github
5. terminal
6. file explorer

how you can see all that stuff don't takes my focus while I am working

# Homeraw mode

title: Doctor Health Hands showing you home raw mode

short video for 3-4 mins

Show in slow more how I am using modification keys without leaving the home row

Actually should be three videos
1. video of what happend on the screen
2. video of how I editing with home raw mode and tab (alternate mode)
3. video of how I editing without kanata

The highlight is how much more comfortable positions for my fingers with kanata.

Just try one time, it is really suuuuper comfortable.

PS. the similar format can be used for "Doctor Health brain showing you the right UX"

# Create language with compiler for system design interviews and LSP
1. Define dictionary, e.g. [ui, back, db, ...]
2. Define connections, smth like mermaid
3. Define maths for scaling

example

```
// variables, every variable a keyword
users = 1000
throughput = 1000 connecion/second

important metrics:
  - amount requests from user
  - amount of data send 
  - amount of storage required to be stored
  - 

the back could be a contructor that takes an input and returns the most appropriate solution
the most appropriate will be the simplest solution with ability to grow

// application
UI > Back > Db

// modules
UI = react SPA
Back = 
```

# VIM one more time

I can usually think and concetrate better when doing smth with my hands

So for that reason I am using graphica planchet for drawing diagrams

Or when speaking on system design stuff

# Shitty code 1 - express, typescript, locals

Shitty code - is code which support is hard, unpleasant and time overconsuming.

It is hard to tell about that, because of infinite variants of implementation

So I am going to show you samples in that series

Compare that, sample with express app locals, which is being set in two different places
with raw code, e.g.

```
// handlers.ts
handler1(req: Request, res: Response) {
    req.app.locals.isRunning = false;
    // ...
}

handler2(req: Request, res: Response) {
    req.app.locals.isRunning = true;
    // ...
}

handler3(req: Request, res: Response) {
    return req.app.locals.isRunning;
}
```

here easy to make a mistake when updating code, and that will be found just in runtime
and if the buggy place wasn't run in test, will be revialed in production

alternative is to create a single file for express state
```
// for example, server.state.ts
const isRunningKey = 'isRunning';

export function setIsRunning(req: Request, value: boolean) {
  req.app.locals[isRunningKey] = value;
}

export function getIsRunning(req: Request): boolean {
  return !!req.app.locals[isRunningKey];
}

// handlers
handler1(req: Request, res: Response) {
    setIsRunning(req, false);
}

handler2(req: Request, res: Response) {
    setIsRunning(req, true);
}

handler3(req: Request, res: Response) {
    return getIsRunning(req);
}
```

With that sample, 
1. it is harder to create a bug later when introducing changes
2. it is possible to cover with unit tests
3. there is type safety, everyone using isRunning app.locals, now operate on a boolean, instead of boolean | undefined
4. it is easier to find all places with find references ()

PS. Bonus link to the example with shitty code, that you can debug
PPS. It is also applied to architecture on larger scale as well
PPPS. That is a sample of architectural guideline decision on code

# Horror - what issues can be brought by deps

Imagine, you are working on a ticket. You close that and forget.
It was a ticket for writing script to generate some assets.

Three months later, you asked to regenerate them.

You run your script, but it fails. And now you have no idea, how to repair it.
Because you was using webpack (Pirate Cherep Icon)

# what is architecture in development

В широком смысле этого слова, архитектура - это медитация, это дао, это йога, это умение формировать реальность.
Обучение этому навыку проходит на протяжении всей жизни.

В разработке - это умение формировать реальность программного продукта, учитывать, то,
 - как он будет жить
 - как он будет использоваться
 - как он будет поддерживаться
 - как он будет развиваться

# Social idea

Сделать большой опрос на тему, какими бы услугами 
вы бы хотели регулярно пользоваться

Это могло бы показать в каких направлениях нужно больше работать

Например, в моём случае,
- еда
- спортзал
- танцы
- отдых под солнцем, чтобы выглядеть свежее))

Тогда можно было увидеть, например, что запросов на танц залы одно количество,
а возможности его удовлетворить нету, значит, можно построить танц. зал.

# VIM chapters

Make video per vim feature - it will check use cases for that features.

For example, substitute:
1. default substitute
2. replace in file
3. replace in selection
4. replace with regex
5. use captchuring groups
6. use history to repeat
7. put replace into macros
8. apply replace to all files - combination for file search with telescope
9. file search with same regex as replace

# VIM

We wanna rock music on background.

If you really love coding and creating software?
If you love understanding how the things work.
If you prefer to write your styles for a button in 3 minutes,
instead of installing the new library.

Listen (Watch).

What if I tell you that you can just do your work.
And in parallel your body will become stronger?
That is one of the reasons to use the nvim.

You just doing your general work
, with you normal speed
, but your typing
, memory and concetration
, enginnering skills
, you toolset (e.g. editing smth via sh)

just growth for free.

So, start now with installing the vim plugin into your IDE.
After you feel familiar/ready you may try to use nvim.

What I have described happened to me in two years.

Now I am using my own configured instance of nvim.

So, once you are ready - go to that video to see what benefits can provide.

And the process of development has never been so
satisfing, fast and full feel of freedom.

Moreover, I feel like now I am being to able to learn
and understand new tools faster.
