# Software that NOT trying to steal your soul - Create faster then AI, create on the speed of thought

What soul lost by software.

Image of brain with some goal.

How the goal is destroyed by accident adv.

Arch
NVIM
Floorp

Minimal focus care UX with super high productivity allowing to work with the speed of thought

Loterally on NVIM my flow just replicate my thoughts immidiadtely I don't need to wait for IDE

So tired from that with other IDEs.

Event don't want to open them.

# Jira Innovations

1. get list of interesting tickets
  - get from predefined filter
  - get by assigned
  - get by sprint
  - get by latest commented and predefined filter

2. get list of activities on the ticket

3. get comments to tickets

# Git LSP

LSP server that checks files for // git-lsp comments

for example, to put a mark that won't allow to commit file, because it has some code for debugging purpose

NVIM is for kings, when you have some task, you are not strugling, but implement it

# Start youtue channel from UX ideas for dev tools

Tell about - no redunant things on the working area, clear top area, extendability, hotkeys, e.g.
- why I like floorp
- why I like nvim
- why I like terminal

# idea for jira replacement/alternative UI

big areas of epic visuall, and to close some task, e.g. vat need lot of people to work

Task assigned to different persons

WHen person open area he can visually see where his attention maybe ready
Every his message, or action will add some weight to him.
Based on that weights it will be easy to restore the full history of task and see what everyone was doing
or just observing. E.g. PR = 2points, comment = 0.1 point, etc.

ofc navigation should be possible in vim style

use pull model with live updates for currently viewed item and notifications instead of online for higher loading speed

# то. на что нужны деньги

Покупать себе крутые спорткары, квартиры, дома, закрывать какие-то хотелки своей(их) женщин(ы)

Открыть тренажёрный зал, танцевальный зал, предоставить их Серегею и Диане, которые меня сейчас тренируют

Это будут как бы мои бизнесы, но в основном управлять ими будут Сергей и Диана, где половина дохода идёт мне, 25% Сергею и Диане, 25% оборот, реинвестиция

Это будут места где дают реально работающие вещи. Какие-то новые вещи с пометкой эксперементально.

В случае Сергея, ему можно дать во владение доп. клуб.

Идея в том, чтобы Сергей и Диана передавали свои знания и квалифицировали новых тренеров.

# Идея - много мониторов для ноутбука

Я хотел нарисовать диаграмму для проги на планшете

Пришло в голову, чтобы было бы прикольно сделать насадку на верх крышки ноутбука

Чтобы на неё можно было прикреплять 1-3 больших планшетов, которые можно было бы настроить как доп. экраны

Так как они сенсорные, то можно было бы на них же и рисовать

Продукт - это держатели для экрана + софт для менеджмента этого добра

Моя роль - найти людей из разных людей и организовать
- кодеры для софта
  - заканчивающие универ? Фриланс? Какое ОС должна быть на плашете? Что если планшет только как доп. экран
- хард инженеры для держалки, которая может адапироваться под разные размеры ноутбука
- реклама
- сбыт
- анализ рынка

Кто может захотеть купить такую штуку - софт + держалка за 100 дол. 
100 дол выглядит как трпимая цена для сеньора с доходом 3к дол.

Если продать 1000 сеньров, то это 100,000 дол. если в проекте 5 человек - половина мне. каждому по 10к
Можно вложиться в меньшие деньги.

Как мне зарабтать, а не тратить? 
Шаг 0 - сделать за дёшево версию для себя, чтобы было что попиарить и проверить возможность сделать за дёшево
  > 3Д печать могут сделать здесь за 20-60р https://craft3d.by/ceni/
    тут же могут сделать и 3д моделирование, но вдруг они попробуют скоммуниздить идею, вдруг у них нету чести?
    ну с учётом фактора скорости и дешёвости это выглядит как наиболее оптимальный вариант
    по идее их же можно будет использовать для поточного производства
  > Софт чтобы использовать планшет как 2й экран https://remontka.pro/android-as-2nd-monitor/
  > так-то выглядит, что продаваться будет только механическая штука. с себе стоимостью допустим 50р, ну пусть продаётся за 250р
250 * 100 = 25000 дохода, можно создать таблицу в эксель с коэф. вероятности покупки в зависимоати от цены и охвата,
например, при цене 100р и охвате 1000 - 100 купит, и при цене 200р и охвате 1000, 10 купит, также нужно учесть момент с доставкой,
т.е. если будет слишком много заказов, может быть сложно доставить, посмотреть каналы сбыта - вб, али, озон (брат может)
> раскрутить канал на ютуб по проге - azure, nvim, general (например, всякие типы про хороший код, или солид, мб ar hitecture)

  чтобы оправдать начальный вариант, можно сделать 2 версии одна хардкор, другая про
  3д принтер + телега для апк вначале, а про версия позже
  3д принтер стоит всего 1000-2500 рублей.

  найти людей, которые запилят это чисто для меня по приколу

  для рекламы вначале "что-вроде для тех, кто готов немного разширить свой воркфлоу"
  поснимать видео с юз кейсами

  3д принтер + инженерка, возможно это отличный вариант для моего брата, он вроде как шарит в работе руками
  софт - посмотреть форумы, спросить на стак оверфлоу
  как устанавливать софт на планшеты? Можно через андроид - через скачку апк файла, **можно распространять апк файл через телегу вначале**, или позже через плеймаркет
  **вначале можно давать скидку за отзыв**
  можно найти студента, который будет рад доп. деньгам, например, 300$ + он получит опыт реальной дистрибьюции приложения
Шаг 1 - разпиарить идею, через свой ютуб канал о софте
Шаг 2 - поднять деньги на предзаказах и кик стартер, возможно инвестициях откуда-то
Шаг 3 - поставить на поток, используя людей с шага 0, брат сможет заниматься доставкой, ему + кеш, и изучать 3Д если заинтересуется
Шаг 4 - если всё по плану, то это 100к, где половина мне, а половина реинвестиция - зп, материала, реклама
Шаг 5 - поставить на поток

Распространение софта могу через веб сделать сам

Инженерную штуку сделать через 3д принтер, позже через реинвестиции можно сделать более дорогую версию
через лучшие материалы, вначале позволит сэкономить на материалах

Сделать рекламу, найти людей, которые могут это сделать.
Через рекламу организовать предзаказ.
Или сделать сбор на кик стартер.
Или и то, и другое.


# Work for programmers - change landscape of industry

Can start from one manufacture for testing.

Business profit - easier monitoring,
more people want to work at that company *earn more*,
higher quality.

*Cut costs* for some extra hard work.

Man profit - remote work.

The issue, goal is not match with goal earn more, that is behind lot of companies.

Input - lot of coders, people want to make money, people want to work remotely.

Solution - create a big software product, where people would be able to control robots to do work

Bug software product - lot of work for lot of devs, lot of teams

Lot of investment

That is basically an attempt to bring money from outher industries when possible.

For example, use robots to bring things. Because of human control it is possible.
Also human able to work remotely. 
But it is more spendings for hotel, since they will need to pay for robots and software.
Before - just for people.

But, what if people want that? Lets the create a vote and government start sponsor that system.

Robo system on taxes from government. 

People can work remotely, developers have work.

Development allows to use lot of analytics and monitoring for best proffesionals.

Actually such project creates really a huge amount of questions - e.g. privacy.

# znatoki dev - feels like cool

Znatok would strong, sexy, clever, with lot of cool characteristics

Kinda looks like a good start for my community I wanted to create

I can start from azure, just need to check what frameworks and tools are being used in itransition, 

Create a game, where people are compete in knowledge of different frameworks.

On start simple questions on the random frameworks

Closer to end smth very confusing, e.g. vim golf, or like the next:

For example, question will that work in windows command prompt "az container create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name mycontainer2 \
    --image mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-wordcount:latest 
    --restart-policy OnFailure \
    --environment-variables 'NumWords'='5' 'MinLength'='8'\
"

Answer no, because in CMD need to use double quoutes


# Nice commen about nvim

https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/17g1ekc/comment/k6dlo6z/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

```
Personally, I enjoy having a PDE (personal development environment). While I work, neovim feels like an extension of my brain fine tuned to the way I work. But also fine tuned differently depending on the project I’m working on.

I don’t wish to go back to an experience designed by someone else for everyone else.

Not just that but neovim has a bigger community, so for the things that I don’t want to spend my time developing, there’s probably already a plug-in for that.

Having a bigger community also means there’s a higher likelihood that bugs will be fixed faster.

# Thoughts about girls 1

The good below is some kind of represtantion of me in the relationship

Good - belive in me, supports my dreams, honest, in controlling of her wishes, ready to pay and invest into relationship

Bad - don't believe in me, don't support my dream, ready to play games but not ready really to pay or invest

Why not to consult about that with Andrew and his friends?

Take his habbit to tell a good question.

# Product - Fast learning

If smbd want to aquire the new skill - provide the best course, that would allow to do that in shortest time
but with high quality

For example, for azure I have already tests, need to add some tasks, mentors, and it will be a ready to go solution

That will be a new learning model with the really cool instruments for self-preparation and real mentors

# Rubrica - NVIM astranaut in the ocean

Showing some really crazy vim stuff in with the cuplet from astronaut in the ocean
done in the bits with me in the left bottom orner vibing in the song while typing that.

sample:
1. generate guids from api request and insert them into '' quotes for processing file

# NVIM channel

Use few different channels or playlist for different goals?

Need to consult about youtube alghorythms with smbd about that.
Feels like one channel about dev and one channel for philosophy is alright.

but all of them should start from ShinShil, e.g.
#ShinShil_nvim
#ShinShil_architecture
#ShinShil_developer_school

I have been using:
1. Visual Studio - 5 years
2. VS Code - 5 years
3. Half of IntelliJ instruments - 5 years
4. Turbopascal, delphi - 2 yeas
5. Sublibe, atom, notepad, netbeans - 1 year
6. datagrip, MS Sql Server, lot of git clients, 

For development. And my 

Intro video - my mood when using different editors
 - office worker a little boring doing his work with different IDEs
   with meter of satisfaction in the brain (in the brain boring monkey)
    - long opening project
    - too hard UX
    - hard to switch between projects
    - no customization when working on laptop
    - no customization for some keymaps
 vs
 - using terminal + nvim - astrounaut in the ocean dance 
     on first part - type nvim in terminal and hit enter with the drop
       check that everything is resolved - slow surpise and start dancing and vibing 
       untill end of the 2nd part
     on second part start doing some project in the bits of the music, showing the full power of nvim
     for editing some stuff - create a project in untill end of the song
     meter of fun should be super high and vibe on very nvim feature
     from to time show title with task, and then resolving it with vibe in nvim style

# Nvim - Multicursor

Show different variants of multicursor
https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/tyg650/i_still_want_multiple_cursors_and_ive_been_using/

Conclusion, some time ago when using Rider/VS code/ visual studio, I was a fun of multicursor, but with time,
 I used to macros, and now feel that they like way more powerfull,
 and that I was too addicted to seing all the changes on screen,
 it gave me feeling that I am doing 10x work xD
 For today I am really happy with macroses and native vim things,
 and don't want to go back for multicursor.

 Morever I am even using neoclip to store some macroses and replay them xD, really handly for me


# Rubrica - Vipendrivaus s NVIM

Rubrica of short videos, where I show smth done with common IDE And something done with NVIM

Examples:

0. Ability to add your own features and ideas instead waiting for ages from community. E.g. show some simple request ticket and sad pink elephant dev. And happy nvim user implementing that in his own.
1. open current file in browser with hotkey
2. execute selection in terminal command
3. use macros for some work, for example, my last formatting when copying content from deep seek
4. macros with quickfix list
5. adding same translation keys in multiple lang files
6. history of macroses
7. use hotkey to do some cool stuff
8. remove everyhing that distract me from doing my work
9. open PR with one button
10. Using macros to generate multiple files in some format - show on different projects to explain why it is so beneficial
11. Show language universally when working on the repo with html, js, dotnet, bicep, yaml, powershell, dockerfile, e.g. before - open many editors, now just nvim
12. customization with scripts
13. comfortable hotkeys that allow to not break fingers when doing some stuff, for example, opening and navigating in files with tab instead of arrows
14. using macros to split multiline from powershell with \ character at the end of every raw

and more

# NVIM Plugins
## transform actions

Set of macroses that allow to do different manipulations in macros way, for example,

1. change different cases
2. wrap
3. save recorded macros to history
4. apply some action across files

# Community of high qualified masters

Extra goal - should be easy to aquire new skill that requires knowege for focus person

For example as a product cool courses with cool auto-tests, checks 

That also could be used to create progress in areas, that could create value, but not money,
  for example, more cool nvim plugins/frameworks))

Today pretty much offers for people who want to take rest,
  or who knows how to controll attention,
  but not really much offers for people who to be a specialist in some field.

Create community of experts.

Membership in that group should MEAN that it is a premium class specialist,
  that brings the reputation of the group,
  that will provide the best possible stuff

Main goal is support growth and to provide first class specialists in the area, for example,
  first class developers, that will make performant, secure, robust aplication which is comforable to use.
  so basically, any who is compete for authority, should have some variant,
  to leave as a master. Provide some money, that should be enough to not worry about money.
  Also should be a rule to work at least 4 hours a day on speciality. On some good work some benefits should come,
  e.g. money bonuses, or guild credits, that could be decided on every month council meeting.

No shared money in the group. Every member should earn on their own.
**However (come from opentowork from Junior spec), not sure if bussiness can cope with it, feels like maybe should be kind of quotas for some amount for members,
just for growing and practicind and learning already known issue**

However, members can use their money to close some community tasks on demand.

Plus makes sense to create a small payouts that will allow members to not work.

The money should be enough for leaving good life - gym, house, food, few girls

Members will be a bank, they will get benefits from creating stuff for other members.

For example, somebody will is able to provide some cool laptops on lower price,
  that person should take a reward. The reward will mastery points.
  I am trying to **remove influence factor**, person should not got authority, person should
  do such things because of willing to make investment into group,
  not because person want to get some power from the group.
  of cours that will create some direct influence, but at least not direct
  that why every member has to be indepent on their own
  to avoid dependency of the community on anyone authority/support

  **main value** should be **idea**, the membership also should provide 
  some benefits like reputation in the out world
  that idea should provide a path for specialist and provide them
  a way to become socially happy because of their skills
  also creating a unity of them is pretty nice thing

  **because idea is main value**
   - no material benefits - e.g. centralized control of money 
   - members should pay small money for being part of community, that money for me and others 
     who support community, that is just a paying work to manage community
   - members should create material themselves, for example, somebody can ask another man
     to support him, while he is without work, or went to take a rest, support for others
     should be part of ideology, also at the same time, ideology should not allow to be without
     creating value
   - main idea of ideology is to support and inspire for practicing skills. Members should be 
     already a proffesionals. They should be like a family with huge respect for others,
     be patient and calm. E.g. the case above with supporting somebody should not be an issue.
     Such things could be automated, e.g. on the website should be information on who is without
     work, who with work. The better variant then bringing somebody just in debt, is to provide him work.
     Community of masters, can find some usefull job for the master, who wish to do smth.
     The minimum amount of time is 4 hours a day, which basically should be ok for master.n
     However, masters, with high chances will want to work themselves, since it is one of goals
     of idelology. 4 hours, because work for life, not life for work
     **So main idea. Work for life, not life for work, at the same time save best KT
       and stimulate spending time onto becoming an expert**
       Ideology stategic points:
       - no material benefits for members
       - members will create benefits themselves for others
       - members will be learned how to deal with woman
       - woman will be learn how to deal with man
       - being an expert should be stimulated
       - being an independent, confident, kind, generous, active human, should be stimulated
       - being a good human just for good human, should be stimulated (because community has to deal with the out world, that may leave on other rules)
       - it should be hard to become a member of the group, including lot of tests to pass ideology block
         - however, everyone can become a member of sub community, where he will able to get smaller benefits
           just because of following ideology. Should be lot of tests for ideology and lot of practical work
           so submember shold understand the goals. 
       - if member is not agree with ideology, he can discuss that
       - **main rules**
         - become a member hard - hard skills + soft skills + stricy ideology checks
         - membership should not provide any benfits for free, it should provide some evidence of being good human
       - should provide some way to have sex if man has no love and not feeling a piece of shit
         , however, it still will be smth not suitable for everyone, since it is still too personal
         **how to deall with keeping personal personal, but helping in fight with depression?**

  exchange of effort on income will be different thing, called a business,
  for example, person may buy/reserve some time of experts for their needs
  before exchange it should clean, what group will do for that person

  so basically, the main value of community should be an idea

  however, also some passive income for every member, who want to be free from work,
  that will be possible from other members support
  also person without work can be called to some work by somebody else from community,
  who creates money, of course not too often, since otherwise that will be the work

  the person without work, has to do smth usefull from to time, for example,
  teach somebody, or make sombody life easier, for example, create some nice nvim plugin.
  so, without work, means more freedom, but not mean without value
  after some period of time without value person will become in debt state,
  once he start making money he should pay the debt

  at some point of time person will be excluded from the group *bad idea, since it destroys the original idea to make idea the main goal* 

  More mastery points will mean more influence and higher rank.
  If someone want to get such master, he should pay more.
  Also more mastery points provides more access to the guild bank.
  Mastery points can exchanged to money or it is possible to buy some internal stuff on that mastery points.

Yes, we need guild bank, so masters can put their some stuff

I will be the first developer. Looks like I need few more genius.

The goal is to create a goal for professionals.

To become a member need to collect reviews from others.
And bypass the enter exam. The rule on the exam.
The exam should be hard, but complitable, during exam 
need to speek with 5-10 other experts.

The membership will be a real evidence of professionality in some field.

Should be a serioud punishment for lye. The goal is to create a reward for thos who want to become a specialist.

The persons here should be really creating cool results.

E.g. I can create system ticket system in just few months in SOLO. 

The person in that guild will be responsible for the reputation of that masters.

The persons will have access to chat with that masters, where he can ask for the help.

The main issue is how to manage authority in that community.

The good variant looks like to automate money split.

Hierarchy should be really strict, creating more or less good conditions for others members.

Leaders may have access to better resources, but they are not allowed to use that resources for their bussinesses.
They will have access just for 1% extras for their needs.
Since leaders are responsible for tracking the whole picture, maybe somewhere more investment required
to keep proffesioanl knowledge and progress.

Leaders = RESPONSIBILITY and compitenence. That is a role that requires both hard skills,
because without hard skills, will be too hard to understand what they control,
and some soft skills as well, people are still people

They also has to be man by: 

Пацаны
1) Усердно тренируйтесь
2) Держите своё слово
3) Правильно питайтесь
4) Расставляйте приоритеты в важных вещах
5) Не позволяйте порокам выходить из под контроля
6) Получайте удовольствие только в том случае, если вы этого заслуживаете
7) Относитесь к людям с уважением
8) Будьте готовы учиться

И также этот человек должен обладать успехом и опытом с противоположным полом
обладать некоторым влиянием и опытом в сфере бизнеса, т.е. быть альфой

Эти требования к руководителю важны, потому что это то, какими хочется видеть участников

Действительно надёжных, преданных, умных проффесионалов, 
чтобы членство в этом клубе было реально стоящим.

Стремление к качеству, будет девизом.

Это очень ответсвенная роль по поддержанию работоспособности сообщества

# VIM Inspiration to start using VIM

VIM gives so much - pleasure from work, free time on my own business and trainigns, 
  so I really want to share about that tool. It is really awesome thing from my point of view.
I think lot of developers who coding can benefit from using vim.

*quite rock in the background*
VIM like a gym, do you want strong body? Start going to gym.
VIM like a personal house that like say goodbye to parents (IDE) and go on your own house

VIM is the way to get a real enjoy from the process of writing code and anything else,
  it is allows to stay focus in literally in touch with the thing you are doing.
  At least, I feel the project like on endings of my fingers.
  I mean any pattern could be converted in the short combination of keys
    and with muscle memory with time that combinations start feel vary native
    and increase speed and comfort of writing and navigating code a lot
    if you ever played games like MOBA you may know difference between quick cast with hotkey and manual cast with mouse
    it is very similar, just instead thunder (zeus ult screen), I can cast smth like 'delete everything between gaps'
    and the nicest thing the I am crafting that skills, you know, prev screen was from dota
    so it is closer to invoker with infinite amount of skills, like in video of well known dota youtuber
    mipo negoroi and invoker in god tier
    most of the time that skills - are the first letters of the words, lets say delete inside (, or change surround ' to "
    you can see it is relatively simple to remember and integrate with native language
    that is a good start
    once you are really familiar with that you are ready to some advanced mappings - positional
    some mappings are not for remember with native language, but to save your wrists when typing a lot
    it is not a joke, try your self typing really fast (100 characters a minute) for few hours
    if you are using different buttons like ctrl, alt, shift, you will start feel pain in wrists
    that why position is important
    hjkl - may look weird but compare it with arrows or even arrows on laptop in terms of comfort for pressing
    you see? It allow to keep your hads on home raw all the time.
    For that reasons for example, I have reassigned some shortcuts in vim for more comfortable from position point of view buttons
    It is easier then it may seems, with time that skill of remembering new keybindings also improves
    Most of the time I am trying you mnemonic shortcuts and use comfort for the most used shortcuts
    Defenitely makes sense. *Show screenshot where user types comment to the youtube video "Wow, defenetily makes sense"*

VIM just impressive because it allows to me do things EXACTLY as I want.

*volume increased Rock in the background*
When you look at my neovim, you look at part of my soul.

few moments of silence and rock - attention catched

What makes vim so good? DRY
You need some to develop some special way of though,
  you need learn how to recgnise patterns,
  for example, here I am making common stuff,
  select bloc, and now I want to run search and replace
  Now I want to run another search and replace across same selection,
    or in that case just want to copy paste that

lets see some sample what how I am typing with VIM without mouse 
*type in beats of the playing rock n roll with showing keys*

See you later in introduction to vim, link to Practical VIM course - lesson 1

Or if you need more reasoning 
 - check that math video that shows why actually vim increase speed of editing code in 3 times.
 - check that comparison in resource usage
 - check that comparison on how vim affects your habbits and way of think
   - it improves your brain power - because you need to work with brain all the time, that like jogging vs sleeping
     you thoughts will become sharper for free
   - it improves you minor motoric
   - it improves mood, basically, have you ever see musician being in good mood just from playing their instrumen?
   - it improves speed of typing
   - it improves your skills of problem solving, because you have a sword that can solve problem,
      bringing it with your self, at some point of time you start think, I need to use it,
      and you will learn how to use it
   - it saved you focus power *blink to my zen mode* alowing you to concetrate more on the work rather then fighting with UI
   - it allows to do things immideately
   - it allows editing via ssh easily
   - it allows to use your laptop morek
   - with time it is drammatic performance boost because of reasons mentioned above and abilities, goals of the vim itself


*btw, nice idea for the plugin - playing music and user need to type in beats different phrases*
*could be motivation phrases, could used instead of monkey typing, when miss, should not fail*

** Lesson 1.5 - advanced vim tools: repeat, macros, registers, search and replace with registers - to use that you need a skill to recognise a pattern, that will go just with time, here some samples
** Lesson 2 - once you are familiar with basics and know smth about vim tools, you are ready to try neovim
  install & setup
  telescope
  lsp
  git
  quickfix lists
  bang operator
  lua in command line
  next think about what you need and search for it, lets check for example copilot (even if not using that xd link to video why I am not using copilot - it interrupts my thoughts, when I am doing work I am fully inside, I have vision and ideas, and copilot breaks that state of concetration and even destroys my skill of being focused, when I feel that realy need some boileraplate I still can do that with vim, even more efficient, since it is fully under my control, e.g. I can in a minute create macors that will be doing what I need for boilerplate and that would be even more accurate in terms of cursor position, etc. Other then that I still can ask smth with AI. But last for example, I had hard issue with common js, and still the decision I have found on my own.)
** Lesson 3 - some advance neovim: bang operator, 

# Innovations

Innovations is an infinte market

By innovations I mean smth new

Inovations can bring profit in different ways, the main I think:
    1. Usefullness, when smth for life invented, e.g. electrocity
    2. Emotions from smth new. When people have enough money and food, they may want sometimes to but smth new
         or to play some game, or to learn new skill
         that empotions possible to find almost in every area - presents for birthday, even small improvements in ux
         lets say, there is a curl. And it works, but time come and somebody create new tool (curly),
         and that is innovation more from emotions (of course it maybe easier to use and more functional, however,
         the core is the same)

so 1 + 2 in different proportions may be wanted to buy

I mean people often want sometimes new, just because it is new 
  and when all "old" new bought, they still looking for smth "new" new

# Productivity

title: Doctor Productivity showing you the right setup

That could be a small series of videos, 
where two videos doing the same thing - editing few files in one project in different and creating a PR:
## Part 1 - fix a bug
1. using nvim setup for development 
2. using IntelliJ for development

## Part 2 - update two different projects in microservices arechitecture
1. using nvim setup for development 
2. using IntelliJ for development

In the end compare of time. And appauses from doctor health hands and doctor health brain

PS. Also nvim setup could reviewed by doctor health hands and doctor health brain

# Clean UX

title: Doctor Health Brain showing you the right UX

PS>I don't need to mention, that I am using nvim! They should ask, wow what editor are you using, in comments.

UX should be clean, less information come into your head - better for it

Lyke in gym, more weight - more tired

Imagine you go to help to put some metal into wagon (meme with speed wagon saying speed wagon)

And then you take few more ganteles, because it is fancy

That how it looks like for me for today

With that idea in mind I have organised my development experience.

First of all I have many projects and I want to switch between them really fast when I need,
that why I am using super fast project switcher.

Once it is opened, 95% of the time I need to open some file, thats why it is my welcome screen.

While I looking on the file, I really not interested in anything else, lets be honest,
I am not as stupid, to forget what I have opened a moment ago.

If I need some extra stuff I can use hotkeys, Doctor Health Hands helped with mapping for that

Few things I rarely needed are:
1. line number
2. col position
3. full file path
4. github
5. terminal
6. file explorer

how you can see all that stuff don't takes my focus while I am working

# Homeraw mode

title: Doctor Health Hands showing you home raw mode

short video for 3-4 mins

Show in slow more how I am using modification keys without leaving the home row

Actually should be three videos
1. video of what happend on the screen
2. video of how I editing with home raw mode and tab (alternate mode)
3. video of how I editing without kanata

The highlight is how much more comfortable positions for my fingers with kanata.

Just try one time, it is really suuuuper comfortable.

PS. the similar format can be used for "Doctor Health brain showing you the right UX"

# Create language with compiler for system design interviews and LSP
1. Define dictionary, e.g. [ui, back, db, ...]
2. Define connections, smth like mermaid
3. Define maths for scaling

example

```
// variables, every variable a keyword
users = 1000
throughput = 1000 connecion/second

important metrics:
  - amount requests from user
  - amount of data send 
  - amount of storage required to be stored
  - 

the back could be a contructor that takes an input and returns the most appropriate solution
the most appropriate will be the simplest solution with ability to grow

// application
UI > Back > Db

// modules
UI = react SPA
Back = 
```

# VIM one more time

I can usually think and concetrate better when doing smth with my hands

So for that reason I am using graphica planchet for drawing diagrams

Or when speaking on system design stuff

# Shitty code 1 - express, typescript, locals

Shitty code - is code which support is hard, unpleasant and time overconsuming.

It is hard to tell about that, because of infinite variants of implementation

So I am going to show you samples in that series

Compare that, sample with express app locals, which is being set in two different places
with raw code, e.g.

```
// handlers.ts
handler1(req: Request, res: Response) {
    req.app.locals.isRunning = false;
    // ...
}

handler2(req: Request, res: Response) {
    req.app.locals.isRunning = true;
    // ...
}

handler3(req: Request, res: Response) {
    return req.app.locals.isRunning;
}
```

here easy to make a mistake when updating code, and that will be found just in runtime
and if the buggy place wasn't run in test, will be revialed in production

alternative is to create a single file for express state
```
// for example, server.state.ts
const isRunningKey = 'isRunning';

export function setIsRunning(req: Request, value: boolean) {
  req.app.locals[isRunningKey] = value;
}

export function getIsRunning(req: Request): boolean {
  return !!req.app.locals[isRunningKey];
}

// handlers
handler1(req: Request, res: Response) {
    setIsRunning(req, false);
}

handler2(req: Request, res: Response) {
    setIsRunning(req, true);
}

handler3(req: Request, res: Response) {
    return getIsRunning(req);
}
```

With that sample, 
1. it is harder to create a bug later when introducing changes
2. it is possible to cover with unit tests
3. there is type safety, everyone using isRunning app.locals, now operate on a boolean, instead of boolean | undefined
4. it is easier to find all places with find references ()

PS. Bonus link to the example with shitty code, that you can debug
PPS. It is also applied to architecture on larger scale as well
PPPS. That is a sample of architectural guideline decision on code

# Horror - what issues can be brought by deps

Imagine, you are working on a ticket. You close that and forget.
It was a ticket for writing script to generate some assets.

Three months later, you asked to regenerate them.

You run your script, but it fails. And now you have no idea, how to repair it.
Because you was using webpack (Pirate Cherep Icon)

# what is architecture in development

В широком смысле этого слова, архитектура - это медитация, это дао, это йога, это умение формировать реальность.
Обучение этому навыку проходит на протяжении всей жизни.

В разработке - это умение формировать реальность программного продукта, учитывать, то,
 - как он будет жить
 - как он будет использоваться
 - как он будет поддерживаться
 - как он будет развиваться

# Social idea

Сделать большой опрос на тему, какими бы услугами 
вы бы хотели регулярно пользоваться

Это могло бы показать в каких направлениях нужно больше работать

Например, в моём случае,
- еда
- спортзал
- танцы
- отдых под солнцем, чтобы выглядеть свежее))

Тогда можно было увидеть, например, что запросов на танц залы одно количество,
а возможности его удовлетворить нету, значит, можно построить танц. зал.

# VIM chapters

Make video per vim feature - it will check use cases for that features.

For example, substitute:
1. default substitute
2. replace in file
3. replace in selection
4. replace with regex
5. use captchuring groups
6. use history to repeat
7. put replace into macros
8. apply replace to all files - combination for file search with telescope
9. file search with same regex as replace

# VIM

We wanna rock music on background.

If you really love coding and creating software?
If you love understanding how the things work.
If you prefer to write your styles for a button in 3 minutes,
instead of installing the new library.

Listen (Watch).

What if I tell you that you can just do your work.
And in parallel your body will become stronger?
That is one of the reasons to use the nvim.

You just doing your general work
, with you normal speed
, but your typing
, memory and concetration
, enginnering skills
, you toolset (e.g. editing smth via sh)

just growth for free.

So, start now with installing the vim plugin into your IDE.
After you feel familiar/ready you may try to use nvim.

What I have described happened to me in two years.

Now I am using my own configured instance of nvim.

So, once you are ready - go to that video to see what benefits can provide.

And the process of development has never been so
satisfing, fast and full feel of freedom.

Moreover, I feel like now I am being to able to learn
and understand new tools faster.
